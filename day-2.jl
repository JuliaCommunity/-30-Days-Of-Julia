# Day 2: Basic syntax and data types

# Learn the basics of the Julia syntax, including data types, variables, and operators
# Practice using the REPL (read-eval-print loop) to run basic calculations and manipulate data
# Example code:

# Define a variable and assign it a value
x = 5

# Use an operator to perform a calculation
y = x + 3

# Print the result of the calculation to the screen
println(y)
