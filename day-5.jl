# Day 5: Strings and string operations

# Learn about strings in Julia, including how to create and manipulate them
# Practice working with strings using built-in functions and operations
# Example code:

# Define a string and print it to the screen
s = "Hello, world!"
println(s)

# Use string functions to manipulate the string
t = replace(s, "world" => "Julia")
println(t)
