# Day 3: Control flow and functions

# Learn about control flow statements, such as if, else, and for loops, and how to use them to control the flow of your code
# Learn how to define and use functions in Julia, including built-in functions and user-defined functions
# Example code:

# Define a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum
function add(x, y)
    return x + y
end

# Call the function with different arguments and print the results
println(add(1, 2))
println(add(3, 4))
