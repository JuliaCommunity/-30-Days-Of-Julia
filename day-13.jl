# Day 13: Working with web services and APIs

# Learn how to work with web services and APIs in Julia, including how to make HTTP requests and parse responses
# Practice using web services and APIs to access and manipulate data from external sources
# Example code:

# Import the HTTP package and use it to make a request to an API
using HTTP
response = HTTP.get("https://api.example.com/v1/users")

# Parse the JSON response and print the result
data = JSON.parse(response.body)
println(data)
