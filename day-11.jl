# Day 11: Introduction to metaprogramming

# Learn the basics of metaprogramming in Julia, including how to use macros and other advanced language features to write flexible and reusable code
# Practice using metaprogramming techniques to extend the capabilities of Julia
# Example code:

# Define a macro that generates a function that calculates the sum of two numbers
macro sum(x, y)
    quote
        $(esc(x)) + $(esc(y))
    end
end

# Use the macro to generate a function and call it with different arguments
@sum(1, 2)
@sum(3, 4)
